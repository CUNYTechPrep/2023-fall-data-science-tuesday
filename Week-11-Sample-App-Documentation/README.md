# Demo Night Details

### When is Demo Night

### Where is Demo Night
* In Person in [Building 92 @ Brooklyn Navy Yard](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BHJ4nvRvaPmp3pEz6)


IMPORTANT: If you are using GPS or an online mapping service to find BLDG 92, enter "Building 92, Flushing Avenue, Brooklyn, NY" or  “Flushing Ave and Carlton Ave, Brooklyn, NY”.  Do not just  use the street address, as there is only one address for the entire 300-acre Yard.

Do not enter “63 Flushing Ave” or just “Brooklyn Navy Yard,” as you will end up in the wrong location.


Do not attempt to enter the Brooklyn Navy Yard through any of the other security entrances, as you will be turned away.

If you plan on taking the subway, the closest stops are York Street (F) and High St (A/C). Alternative transportation options, as well as driving, biking, or ferry directions are here.

Here are more details on how to get there including subway, car shuttle, ferry, bike and bus: [Planning your trip to BNY](https://www.brooklynnavyyard.org/directions-map/)
